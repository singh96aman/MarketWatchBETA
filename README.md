# MarketWatch
 A Beta Site that is built on FLASK and MYSQL platform. It is a stock market web application that lets user add companies to their personal portfolio and we run prediction algroithms (Support vector Machines) to advice user to invest in the company or not.
 
This project illustrates the use of Database management system, Web Development (FLASK) and Machine Learning (SVM).

Every user can create their own portfolios and then later add companies from NSE and BSE. To make better decisions we have used machine learning algorithms such as SVM on the last 10 year stock data to predict the direction of movement of stock. (Refer to screenshots) and the probability of movement of stock. 

This project was highly recognized and later converted into a live stock trading model.
